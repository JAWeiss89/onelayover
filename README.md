## ✈️👩🏽‍✈️ About
onelayover is the travel app made for flight attendants. Flight attendants (and pilots) travel in a very unique manner: often times, work takes them to far away cities where they have limited time to make the most of their visit. Traditional travel apps may recommend visiting sites that are too far away or too inpractical to do on a layover. onelayover solves this by providing a platform for crew-members to share with their peers practical and safe places to visit.
